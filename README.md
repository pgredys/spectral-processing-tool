# Spectral Processing Tool

GUI based spectral processing tool for data analysis. Tool should enable detrending, viewing data in time, calculating its envelope and instantaneous frequency, estimating its power spectral density using periodogram and a chosen model-based method.

## Features

Main functionalities developed in this project are:

* Fast Fourier Tronsformation (FFT), implemented by autors,
* Hilbert transformation
* Detrending 
* Periodogram
* ...
