# Spectral Processing Tool

GUI based spectral processing tool for data analysis. Tool should enable detrending, viewing data in time, calculating its envelope and instantaneous frequency, estimating its power spectral density using periodogram and a chosen model-based method.

## Features

Main functionalities developed in this project are:

- [x] Hilbert transformation
- [x] Envelope calculation 
- [x] Detrending 
- [x] Periodogram
- [x] Welch
- [x] Viewing data in time domain
- [x] Viewing data in frequency domain
- [ ] Read/write data to file
